# Benchmarks HK take home assignment

 

Your task is to create an implementation of the AuthenticationService interface. Feel free to implement any other

interfaces you feel necessary, or add additional classes and interfaces, but do try to keep your code simple.  Do not

CHANGE any of the provided interfaces.  Read the API comments carefully.

 

You also MUST update the AccessPoint class - make sure the function in it returns a fully constructed instance of your

service implementation.

 

Methods that can fail should throw derivatives of RuntimeException with meaningful descriptions.

 

Make sure your solution has comprehensive unit tests.

 

*

 

If you use external libraries outside of the standard JDK, please mention in the README and explain their purpose. Your

goal should be to use as few external libraries as possible.

 

You have 48 hrs to complete the exercise from the point it's received. Once done, pls return the submission via email

or public Github (and then send us the details).

 

The files for the project can be found below. Save them into the appropriate directory structure first.

 

Feel free to add whatever comments regarding your implementation below the line.
